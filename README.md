# CI <sup>2</sup>: A Nerds' Jounral

Please visit https://ci2.us. This journal was created originally for students to practice their academic writing and share their thoughts.

> Remark: The journal website was build based on R Blogdown + Hugo with a HugoMac theme designed by Dr. Yihui Xie. The code was modified from the open code of Captial of Statistics (www.cosx.org) which was also contributed by Dr. Xie and other data scientists.

How to use the site:
- Create a new post in the content/posts folder. Follow the naming convention to make sure that the posts are displayed in the intended order.
- Define an author and image. Post images are stored at assets/images.
- Author data is stored in the main config.toml with a name, bio, and image. Author images are located at static/img/authors. For help with file path view the example posts.
- A post can be put in the featured position on the main page by adding "featured" to the tags. I recommend only having one post tagged as featured at a time.
- I couldn't get the search functionality to work, so I have hidden it along with some other features such as author social media. You can find the code labeled and commented out in the relevant files inside themes/pehtheme-hugo-main.
- The latex is broken in the Galton Machine post. This is a holdover from the original website where it is also broken
